# 30 Life Lessons on Year 30

**Introduction:** Why on Year 30? Because the Reminiscence Bump tendency (an observation that we have better recollection of events that occured in our early adulthood) suggest that we give great significance in this time period a lot. This list of 30 lessons are what I've learnt
<!--- 1. Pessimistically, your thirties are probably the last chance you can align stars (compound) --->
<!--- 2. Worse, the Reminiscence Bump might also pre-empt the "Valley of Regrets". --->

**Life Pro Tips**
1. Apply sunscreens! Your future self *will* thank you! 
2. Level up with compound exercise! ([thoughts](#level-up-with-compound-exercise))
3. Gain superpower memory with Anki flashcards
4. Try singing. Try breathing. Try music training. They might allow you to connect with your emotions better. ([thoughts](#try-singing))
5. Try coffee. With good sleep, it might improve your overall well-being.
6. Try improv theatre. It might improve your social well-being
7. Multiply your confidence with Fashion
8. Try backing up your data. Your future self might thank you 
9. Try creating a theme of the year. Try noting down random stuffs. 
10. Try looking at different horizons (in real life, not photos)
<!--- Learn short cuts--->

**Wisdom/Fluff**

11. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. ([source](https://www.navyseal.com/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast/): probably Navy Seal) <!--- aka more haste less speed --->
12. Define done. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done): popularised by GTD)
13. Knowledge is mostly taught, values are always caught ([thoughts](#knowledge-is-mostly-taught-values-are-always-caught)) 
14. Pareto principle's corollary: What brought you here, probably won't bring you further to where you want to be.

<!---
4. Graphs vs Checklist
16. Fight another day. For problems I can't fix, I believe I can manage it. (But don't try and fix everything!)
-->


**Things I changed my view on**

15. Compromise is not *always* a virtue. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmf6bWl-Hco 
): Middle-ground fallacy) <!--- Yet, it's okay not to have an opinion on everything --->
16. (Deprecate this) The science may be right but it might not apply to you ([source](https://archive.is/diPmQ): long-lived smokers have extraordinary gene variants)
17. The best products also need good marketing
18. Machine problems are easier than human problems
<!--- 16. The English language is... good enough. --->

**On Holding On vs Letting Go**

19. Don't overdo letting go. It's okay to feel a bit of pain. The dividing line is how much you've learnt about the pain in the past. <!--- that you chose to accept rather than the past you choose to escape.-->
20. Don't underdo holding on. It's okay to be a bit controversial. We can't satisfy everyone. It's always better to take a small stance than to be a blind follower. The dividing line is open-mindedness.

<!--- 7. Fuck perfectionist HAHA -->

**On Communication and Relationships**

21. Try check-in with friends in December
22. Temper honesty with love ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI): *How To Speak* Ted talk)
23. Seek first to understand others, than to be understood by others
24. Communication is hard. If you are both clear AND concise, you have already aligned the 2 most important stars. 
<!--- 25. Alignment is pretty important. --->

<!---
Another reason is hard to draw boundaries. The third reason is because 
Hard work equals success
I'm pretty sure you learn that in your 20s that this has a bunch of asterisk...
-->

**On Happiness and Meaningfulness**

<!-- ([thoughts](#on-happiness-and-meaningfulness)) -->

25. I believe a baseline amount of money is necessary for baseline Happiness. ([source](https://behavioralpolicy.princeton.edu/news/DK_wellbeing0323): Kahneman) But beyond the baseline... 
26. I believe Life (with capital L) can be reduced to 2 necessary atomic components: Happiness and Meaningfulness ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aEQDi2ZYCI))


**On Leadership and Management**
27. A manager is a parent that prioritises the organisation's wants and needs. A leader is also a parent but prioritises the workers's wants and needs. <!--- A leader is someone that follows the rules, a good leader is someone that knows when to break them--->
28. 


<!-- 28. Happiness and Meaningfulness are subjective. I believe what gives Happiness or Meaningfulness are fully up to the individual.
29. Happiness and Meaningfulness are extremely rarely each other. I believe they are a duality (i.e. They are mutually exclusive in everyday life but at the fundamental level, are probably the same?)
30. The cause of Lesson (29) is probably modernity; Happiness and Meaningfulnessâ€¦ has probably been separated by Modernity. -->
<!--- 31. There is a fine balance between reading enough food reviews to know how to appreciate the food Vs not spoiling the experience of eating the food. Expections vs Unexpected surprises--->

<!---
Psychology's maslow hierarchy,
Pop self-improvement's Ikigai
Philosophy's existanalism,
Literature's Each of us has a journey?
Theology's ...
Everyone is correct -->


## Level up with compound exercise

## Try Singing

## Knowledge is mostly taught, values are always caught

## On Happiness and Meaningfulness 
1. This is a very fluffy section. 
2. First example: Food. Happiness would be food that taste nice. Meaningfulness would be food that has nutritional value. 
3. What is good tasting food is extremely subjective (e.g. chocolates, Durian). What is nutritional food is subject to your physical goals (e.g. fats to survive colder climate)
4. Second example: Jobs. Happiness would be jobs that pay well. Meaningfulness would be jobs that make an impact to society.
5. While I'm probably yes-anding every single belief system by acknowledging that everyone is right and no one is right... Yet, the main heart of the article is that Meaningfulness should be part of any discussion of capital-L Life; not just Happiness. 
6. Lastly, I don't think modernity's <!--- (or language's) ---> focus on Happiness is a sign of hedonism. I'm quite appreciative that modernity has enabled humanity to pursue maximising Happiness while securing minimum Meaningfulness. A true hedonist would compromise Meaningfulness to maximise Happiness (neglecting family, health). 
7. And thus, we choose. 
<!--- The biggest evidence of the Happiness/Meaningfulness duality is **correct** is by asking any parent: Does raising a child make your life happier? Probably not. Raising a child is extremely tough! --->

<!--- The biggest evidence of the Happiness/Meaningfulness duality is **flawed** is ... --->

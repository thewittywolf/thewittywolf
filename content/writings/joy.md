### What is Happiness? It's up to the individual!
Personally, I very rarely use the word Happiness without also using the word Meaningfulness in the same sentence.

I had derived joy from eating the delicious food such as wagyu beef. I have been awed by the beauty of complex equations such as FFT. I have laughed to the top of my lungs playing nintendo switch with my friends ... I have also felt relief scrolling social media. I have felt joy seeing Trump in misery

Yet Happiness is special. I believe we each can define what Happiness means. If I'm stuck on an island, what are things I need? One of them is coffee. May that island be able to grow coffee cherries

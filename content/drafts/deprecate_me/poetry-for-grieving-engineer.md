I cannot understate how embedded this "official" way is of the human condition. I would even go as far as to say that in a post-apocalyptical world, where there are no screens to play videos or museums to indulge in visuals... 

The second way mostly ditches the rhymes, meters and other technical features... and traded for, in my view, images.

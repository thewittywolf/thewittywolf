On emotions - Are humans the only animals capable of emotional tears?
> Other species produce tears, but ours is the only one that scientists believe consistently cries not just to lubricate and protect the eyeballs, but also to express emotion 

On emotions - Are tears from great emotions (Joy, Awe, Sorrow, etc...) rooted in powerlessness? But if so, why not Fear (i.e. another emotion rooted in powerlessness)? And I'm doubtful people shed tears from anxiety... 
> That feeling of powerlessness often accompanies tears of frustration, and it may even explain the tears some people shed when they feel emotionally overwhelmed, whether from joy, anxiety or awe. In fact, Dr. Vingerhoets called helplessness “the core element of crying,” since it harks back to the original evolutionary purpose of tears: needing assistance or support.

On emotions - How do you support a person crying? Either through a hug or a validation of feelings?
> In social situations, the biggest factor influencing how you feel after crying is how the people around you react. People who receive a supportive response, like a hug or validation of their feelings, tend to feel better, while those whose tears are met with anger or ridicule are more likely to feel worse. This makes sense, as experts think the primary purpose of the tear, no matter your age, is to communicate distress to others.

On culture - Are boys/men suppressing tears because of culture norms? 
> “Boys might inhibit their crying for fear of violating a gender stereotype,” Dr. Rottenberg said.

On culture - 
> Scientists like to show the movies “The Champ,” “Beaches” and “Atonement” to research subjects to try to get them to cry.

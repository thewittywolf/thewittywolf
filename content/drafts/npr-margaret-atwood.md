### On emotions -- Managing anger (coping mechanism-ish)... by writing them into fiction 

> Martin: I am curious how you manage that. You were just able to just let it go? Or did any of that get under your skin?
> 
> Atwood: Oh, no, I'm a vengeful person.
>
> Martin: Are you being serious?
>
> Atwood: Oh, yes, I'm quite vengeful. I can't help it. It's who I am. So I make them into idiotic people in fiction.

### On emotions -- The difference between despair and sorrow

> Atwood: Oh sorrow. Sorrow. That's a different thing. I think sorrow is natural. And I had a friend once in the age when a psychiatrist thought it was a good idea to give you a lot of drugs if you were going through grieving and sorrow, and then you just wouldn't feel it. What that means is you never get over it, because you haven't had that experience, which is a very human one, and everyone has it sooner or later. It's grief.
